# Gumbo Builder

_This repository is deprecated. Gumbo is now built using https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/tree/master/G/Gumbo _
This repository builds binary artifacts for the [Gumbo](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) project on multiple platforms.

The builds were created for use with the [Gumbo Julia Binding](https://github.com/porterjamesj/Gumbo.jl), but can be used on their own. The builds can be downloaded from the [github release page](https://github.com/aviks/GumboBuilder/releases) for this project.
